When setting up software package repositories, for example using
[reprepro](http://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/), it is sometimes
useful to have an empty Debian package to get the thing initialised.

This bundle has such a package, along with its `.changes` file,
and the packaging data for rebuilding it, should anyone wish to.
